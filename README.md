# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends. first module.

## Overview of Project
For this project we analyzed a data set based on kickstarter information to see the outcomes of various kickstarter campaigns to see how Louise's campaign compares to other ones with the same theme. Using excel I could filter the data and get the data organized so we can look at specific campaigns.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise understand her outcomes based on the data we have. To do this we made graphs and interpreted data based on other kickstarter campaigns. We also used excel to see statistics based on the amount pledged and the goal amount to understand a reasonable goal for a kickstarter campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
For this analysis we had to manipulate the data given to us to see what was really going on. We had to convert the dates to ones we could read then make a graph based on the start date of campaigns to see if there was a trend based on that. Some months showed more promise than other. We also looked at the campaign length to get a better picture. Some of the challenges associated with the data was using key functions to turn the data into something we could understand. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The outcomes based on the launch date of a kickstarter campaign and more specifically for theater campaigns can be seen below in figure 1.
 
In this figure we can see that there is a spike in successful campaigns in May and June. This would be an excellent time to start a campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When analyzing the data in terms of outcomes vs the goal asked for we see a steady drop in the percent of successful campaigns as the goal is increased. Then there is a peak from a goal of 35000 to around 40000. This is illustrated in figure 2. 
This could be because of multiple factors such as advertisements and the country for which these campaigns are in.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Using new functions that excel has was probably the most difficult aspect of this assignment. We had to use the counifs functions to understand the data based on outcome vs goals. A second challenge is ultimately interpreting the data to provide Louise with successful insight into her campaign.

## Results
For this campaign it would be safe to say that the most reasonable start day would be either in May or June as they showed the most promise based on the data given to us.
For the outcomes based on the given goals I would recommend to keep the goal to under 15000 to have the highest success. The chart showed earlier shows a decrease in success as the goal gets higher unless youâ€™re asking for a goal between 35000 to 40000 but there is also less data in between these ranges
